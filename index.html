        Session types statically guarantee that concurrent communication  complies with a protocol. We give the first formal account of session typing with exception handling in a functional programming language. We define a core calculus which satisfies preservation and progress properties, is deadlock free, data-race free, and terminating. We provide the first implementation of session typing with exception handling for a fully fledged functional programming language, by extending the Links web programming language. Our implementation draws on existing work on algebraic effects and effect handlers. We illustrate our implementation through a chat server application for the web, in which all communication occurs over session typed channels and disconnections are handled gracefully.

The π-calculus, viewed as a core concurrent programming language, has
been used as the target of much research on type systems for
concurrency. We propose a new type system for deadlock-free session-
typed π-calculus processes, by integrating two separate lines of
work. The first is the propositions-as-types approach by Caires and
Pfenning, which provides a linear logic foundation for session types
and guarantees deadlock-freedom by forbidding cyclic process
connections. The second is Kobayashi’s approach in which types are
annotated with priorities so that the type system can check whether
or not processes contain genuine cyclic dependencies between
communication operations. We combine these two techniques for the
first time, and define a new and more expressive variant of classical
linear logic with a proof assignment that gives a session type system
with Kobayashi-style priorities. This can be seen in three ways: (i)
as a new linear logic in which cyclic structures can be derived and a
cycle-elimination theorem generalises cut-elimination; (ii) as a
logically- based session type system, which is more expressive than
Caires and Pfenning’s; (iii) as a logical foundation for Kobayashi’s
system, bringing it into the sphere of the propositions-as-types
paradigm.</p></td>

      </tr>
      <tr><td colspan="3" class="abstract">
          Stencil computations are widely used from physical simulations to
 machine-learning. They are embarrassingly parallel and are commonly
 executed on modern parallel systems such as multi-core CPUs, Graphic
 Processing Units (GPUs). Although stencil computations have been
 extensively studied, optimizing them for increasingly diverse and
 ever-changing hardware remains challenging even for performance
 experts. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have raised the programming
 abstraction and offer good performance. However, this abstraction
 places the burden of optimizing stencil codes for the targeted
 architectures on DSL implementers who have to write full-fledged
 parallelizing compilers and optimizers for every architecture.

 Lift has recently emerged as a promising approach to achieve
 performance portability. It is based on a small set of reusable
 parallel primitives that DSL writers can build upon. Lift’s key
 novelty is in its encoding of optimizations as a system of extensible
 rewrite rules which are used to explore the optimisation. So far,
 Lift has focused on linear algebra operations and it it is an open
 question if this approach is applicable for other domains.

 In this talk, I demonstrate how complex multidimensional stencil
 codes and optimizations such as tiling are expressible using
 compositions of simple 1D Lift primitives. This allows us to build an
 elegant optimizing compiler using rewriting without requiring
 specialized domain- or architecture-specific solutions. By leveraging
 existing Lift primitives and optimizations, we only require the
 addition of two primitives and one rewrite rule to do so. Our results
 show that this approach outperforms existing compiler approaches and
 hand-tuned codes.

        High-performance computing is turning towards heterogeneous solutions in the search for performance and power-efficiency. Building compute nodes with multi-core CPUs, GPUs and
especially FPGAs allows for a large degree of configurability. However this brings with it the challenge of finding the optimum configuration. 
The TyTra compiler seeks to optimise streaming dataflow applications, on heterogeneous platforms, with the help of type transformations and an accurate cost/performance model.
From a source program, TyTra generates multiple program variants, costs them and selects the best performing variant.
This work looks at ways to optimise program variant generation and selection in TyTra. We do this by leveraging the structure of the applications considered as well as constraints imposed by the target hardware architecture. We present our approach to an optimal program variant selection algorithm that relies on pruning to meet resource constraints.

Understanding and controlling software energy usage is an increasing
concern in many settings. To date, there has been little work,
 however, on understanding how energy relates to high level
programming constructs, or on dealing with real parallel systems,
especially at a significant scale. In this paper, we measure and
correlate the energy usage of several parallel Haskell programs
against execution time and other runtime system (RTS) metrics,
produced using the standard Haskell compiler, GHC. We show how energy
usage relates to the number of cores, giving performance results on
a recent Intel Xeon x86 system that has 28 physical cores
and supports hyperthreading. From these results, we construct
an energy model and relate this model to the parallel structure of
the program source. Given a suitable structural model of parallelism,
this provides information that can be used to predict the energy.
